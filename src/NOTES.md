## Notes
- cat_vs_roomba is a great example of how to work with tiles/collisions
- cat_vs_roomba has a special mode toggle set in screens.h to enable a tracemap and make the screen larger for aligning tiles
- koala_seasons uses an atlas (pixel art all on one sprite sheet) and then uses defines to mark each individual texture
- skully_escape has some of the best file organization monsters and players have a unique file with header.
